# TheCork

Restaurant reservation made easy with *TheCork*! 

## General Information

Customers can display a list of restaurants available at their location and are able to book a table for a specific number of people if the restaurant still has free tables. 
TheCork also provides back-office for the restaurants which is used to manage the schedule and to approve or deny the customers reservations.

### Built With

*Python* is used as primary programming language. The API Server is implemented using the *Flask* web framework which is a Python module that lets you develop web applications easily. The database server is running with MySQL server and the queries are performed by *SQL-Alchemy*. 

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Programming Language and Platform
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) - Web Application Framework
* [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) - Database Management Framwork

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Linux machine running Ubunu 20.04 or higher.

### Deployment (for testing purposes)

First, execute the following two commands in you console:

```
export FLASK_APP=TheCork
export FLASK_DEBUG=True
```

Then, navigator to the parent folder of this project and run:

```
flask run
```

### Deployment (for production purposes)

Originally, project requires four seperate virtual machines running Ubuntu 20.04. 
The following paragprah details how to set up these virtual machines

#### **Virtual Machine 1** (External Machine):

* Assign the IP address 192.168.0.100 to network adapter `enps03`:

```
sudo ifconfig enp0s3 192.168.0.100/24 up
sudo /etc/init.d/network-manager force-reload
```

* Set VM2 as default gateway:

```
sudo ip route add default via 192.168.0.10 
```

#### **Virtual Machine 2** (Screening Router):

* Assign the IP address 192.168.0.10 to network adapter `enps03`, 192.168.1.1 to `enps08` and 192.168.2.1 to `enps09`:

```
sudo ifconfig enp0s3 192.168.0.10/24 up
sudo ifconfig enp0s8 192.168.0.254/24 up
sudo ifconfig enp0s9 192.168.0.1/24 up
sudo /etc/init.d/network-manager force-reload
```

* Activate Port Forwaring:

```
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

* Configure the firewall with the following commands:

```
$ sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
$ sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP

$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
$ sudo iptables -A FORWARD -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

$ sudo iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -d 192.168.1.1/24 --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
$ sudo iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -d 192.168.2.15 --dport 3306 -j ACCEPT

$ sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i enps03 -p tcp --dport 443 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.1:443
```

#### **Virtual Machine 3** (API Server):

* Assign the IP address 192.168.1.1 to network adapter `enps03`:

```
sudo ifconfig enp0s3 192.168.1.1/24 up
sudo /etc/init.d/network-manager force-reload
```

* Set VM2 as default gateway:

```
sudo ip route add default via 192.168.1.254 
```

* Install Apache2:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2
```

* Add [this configuration file](apache_files/webapp2.conf) to the folder `/etc/apache2/sites-available`. Within the *.conf file* you have to modify the paths to match you setup.

* Within the folder `var/www/` add a folder called *TheCork*. In this folder you can add the project folder and rename it to *TheCork*. Additonally, add [this file](apache_files/webapp2.wsgi) and again, modify the paths accordingly. You can verify that everything is setup correctly by running:

```python
sudo apache2ctl configtest
```

* Activate the website by running the following command in the terminal:

```python
sudo a2enmod ssl                # Activate SSL Engine
sudo a2ensite thecork.conf      # Activate Website
sudo systemctl reload apache2   # Reload Apache
```

* Now, you should be able to call the website in the browser of your choice (tested on Firefox) under the IP address `192.168.1.1:443`

#### Virtual Machine 4 (Database Server):

* Assign the IP address 192.168.2.4 to network adapter `enps03`:

```
sudo ifconfig enp0s3 192.168.2.4/24 up
sudo /etc/init.d/network-manager force-reload
```

* Set VM2 as default gateway:

```
$ sudo ip route add default via 192.168.2.254 
```

* Install MySQL-Server and start the server:
```
$ sudo apt install mysql-server
$ sudo systemctl start mysql.service
```

* Adjust how your root MySQL user authenticates to avoid an error when running the configuration script:
```SQL
$ sudo mysql
mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '<your_password>';
mysql> exit
```

* Now configure the security. Go through this guided questionaire step by step:
```
$ sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

* After that being done, you can add a user for your API server to communicate with the database:
```SQL
$ sudo myslq -u root -p
mysql> CREATE USER 'thecork'@'192.168.1.1' IDENTIFIED BY '<your_password>';
mysql> CREATE DATABASE thecork
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON thecork.* TO 'thecork'@'192.168.1.1';
```

* In case something does not working, you can try restarting MySQL ith the following command:
```
$ sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart
```
The rest is automatically done by the SQL-Alchemy framework when running the website.

### Testing

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

Give users explicit instructions on how to run all necessary tests. 
Explain the libraries, such as JUnit, used for testing your software and supply all necessary commands.

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example command
```

## Demo

Give a tour of the best features of the application.
Add screenshots when relevant.
